# Thief-of-Time
Code for my personal Unity game. Very much unfinished, but it has some neat stuff like a serializable attack dictionary and an easily adjustable movement system.
While it may not function as an actual game yet, it's a basic framework for a 2D platformer.

Here's a VERY UNPOLISHED design doc. Needs to be cleaned up and updated.
